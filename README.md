# Hi there 😼

I'm Suchitra.

I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology. 

Aside from going to classes and keeping up with assignments, you'll find me building highly functional webapps and a pinterest-worthy desk setup that almost makes the debugging seem peaceful.

My main tech stack: <br>
<ul>
<li>Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Frameworks: React, Angular, Node.js <br></li>
<li>Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL <br></li>
</ul>

I'm currently learning Python and SQL in the context of data analysis and AI.

When I'm not staring at my computer, I'm likely reading, writing, or sketching.

Let's connect 🤎
